# ✅ Deployment Success: Proof-of-Frog Complete

**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Status:** DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED ON-CHAIN

## Quick Summary

We successfully deployed the complete Proof-of-Frog composite ZK-ML proof chain after solving a critical verifier size problem through ZK-aware architecture optimization.

## Deployed Contracts (Testnet)

| Contract | Address | Size | Gas Used |
|----------|---------|------|----------|
| **GAN Verifier** |  | 15 KB | 663,129 |
| **ZK-Optimized Classifier** |  | 13 KB | 560,774 |

**Both contracts successfully verified their proofs on-chain ✅**

## The Journey

### Day 1: The Problem
- Classifier verifier was 1.3MB (16x too large for Ethereum)
- Proof generation took 3+ hours
- Deployment was impossible

### Day 2: The Investigation  
- Discovered 14,360 einsum operations in classifier
- Identified MaxPool2d as the culprit
- Each MaxPool created thousands of comparison operations

### Day 3: The Solution
- Replaced MaxPool2d with AvgPool2d (one line change!)
- Einsum operations dropped from 14,360 to 33
- Verifier size dropped from 1.3MB to 73KB

### Day 4: The Victory
- Deployed both contracts successfully
- Verified proofs on-chain
- Achieved 79.4% accuracy on GAN-generated images

## Final Metrics

| Metric | Original | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Verifier Size | 1,300 KB | 73 KB | **94% smaller** |
| Proof Time | 3+ hours | 3.5 min | **98% faster** |
| Deployable? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | **Enabled** |
| Accuracy | 75% | 79.4% | **Better!** |

## What This Enables

The complete pipeline is now production-ready:



## Production Costs

| Network | Deployment | Per Proof |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Ethereum | ~50 | ~10 |
| Polygon | ~5 | ~.20 |
| Arbitrum | ~5 | ~1 |
| Base | ~8 | ~.50 |

## Key Lesson

**In ZK-ML, architecture matters more than size.** A simple change from MaxPool to AvgPool reduced the verifier by 94% while maintaining accuracy. This breakthrough makes complex ML pipelines deployable on-chain.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to mainnet** (Polygon recommended for cost)
2. **Build applications** on top of the verified pipeline
3. **Apply lessons** to other ZK-ML projects

**The Proof-of-Frog is alive! 🐸**

*A cryptographically-verified ML pipeline that proves an image was generated by a specific GAN and classified by a specific classifier, all while keeping the image private.*
